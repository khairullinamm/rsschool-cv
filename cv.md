# About me:
I am 20 years old, studying at the Faculty of information and analytical security systems in the 3rd year, so I have basic experience in the IT field.

I understand that the profession in the field of information security is not very interesting, so I decided to try to master web development. At the university, I was in practice at LG Electronics, where I received basic knowledge in the field of development. After that, I realized that I wanted to delve into this area.
